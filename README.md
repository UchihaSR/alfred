# Alfred
A collection of POSIX compliant shell scripts that do everything for you, just like a butler

# Why does it exist?
This is a collection of shell scripts that I use on a daily basis,
most of which I have written myself in order to indulge my laziness and/or in order to escape doing something actually worth while.

Hopefully you will get some use out of these 
and in return, I, some gratification.
